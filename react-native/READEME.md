# React Native

- Use React following the [React Guide](/react/)
- Use [TypeScript](/typescript/)
- Prefer using [core components and apis] over writing bespoke components.
- Prefer grouping logic by feature rather than implementation detail.

[core components and apis]: https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis

## Style

- Prefer [in-line and composable styles]
- Avoid designing for only one platform.
- Avoid designing for only one screen size.
- Prefer common mobile patterns and avoid [non-standard patterns].

## Testing

- Prefer testing on physical devices.
- Use [detox] for integration tests.
